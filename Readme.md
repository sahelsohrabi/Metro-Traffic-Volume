# Metro Traffic Volume

This project analyzes metro passenger traffic volume. The main goal is to study passenger usage patterns and predict traffic under various conditions.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tools and Methods

Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing traffic patterns.  
Python (Machine Learning) for modeling and traffic prediction.  
Machine learning algorithms for forecasting passenger volumes.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Features

Analysis of metro traffic based on:

- Different hours of the day
- Different days of the week
- Various weather conditions (sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.)

- Interactive dashboards to display traffic variations over time and weather conditions.
- Predicting passenger volumes using historical data.
- Comparing machine learning model results with actual data.
